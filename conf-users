The qmail system is heavily partitioned for security;  it does
almost nothing as root.

The first eight lines of this file are the users used by qmail
itself. These are
 - the alias user,
 - the daemon user,
 - the log user,
 - the owner of miscellaneous files such as binaries,
 - the passwd user,
 - the queue user,
 - the remote user and
 - the send user.

The names can be changed, but the order of the users have been
kept!
